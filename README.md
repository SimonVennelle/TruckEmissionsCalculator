# TruckEmissionsCalculator
A web based tool to calculate the emissions of freight trucks using different fuel types.
The styling and imagery of the website is based on the Truck Industry Council website who were the mock clients of the project.

The page was created as part of University project in a collaboration with Joshua Hallam, Kulwinder Malhi & Tavleen Kaur.
